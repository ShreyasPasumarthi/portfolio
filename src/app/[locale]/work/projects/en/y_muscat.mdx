## Inspiration
NASA JPL teams need software to plan and test mission concepts for novel satellite missions to asteroids.

<br />
## What MuSCAT does
The Multi-Spacecraft Concept and Autonomy Tool (MuSCAT) is a low-fidelity platform for simulating multi-agent and single-agent satellite missions to asteroids and testing autonomy algorithms.
- **Functional-level Autonomy**: Simulates spacecraft's Navigation, Attitude determination and control, Power, Communication (both direct-to-Earth and inter-spacecraft), Thermal, and Science instruments
- **System-level Autonomy**: MuSCAT uses NASA's mexec platform for planning and scheduling, a technology used on the Mars Perserverance rover's Onboard Planner
- **Autonomy Algorithm testing**: MuSCAT can easily simulate a single-spacecraft or multi-spacecraft mission (to Small Body), and prove the mission needs autonomous functions, or can be carried out from the ground
<br />

## How PyMuSCAT Was Built
MuSCAT simulations were often time-intensive due to it being built on MATLAB and ROS. The two did not play well together, resulting in simulations taking hours to run. So I built PyMuSCAT, a Python-based version of the platform, to integrate better with ROS.
I completely refactored the codebase, translating thousands of lines of MATLAB code into Python. 
<br />

## Challenges
I had little aerospace engineering experience, let alone the experience needed to simulate satellite dyanamics, so I reached out to my mentor and to the other interns in my group, two Stanford PhD students with aerospace backgrounds, and sought their advice.
I looked through the codebase to isolate the components with the least dependencies and focused on the most useful and independent part of the code. I built that, learning the aerospace concepts I needed to along the way, and bit by bit, built the platform.
<br />

## Accomplishments
I was able to integrate a diverse set of technologies in a cohesive way, reducing runtime by 72.3%. I was also able to build and translate autonomy algorithms to successfully simulate a satellite navigating to an asteroid, which was very exciting.

## What I learned

I got to learn about systems engineering, satellite design, aerospace engineering, and how to create simulations in Python and C++. I also learned how to use Docker, Kubernetes, and Jenkins to containerize, deploy, and automatically test code.
